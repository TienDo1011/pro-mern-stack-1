Each section in the book ends with a working application, which corresponds to a branch in this
repository. For each section, you can browse the complete source, or look at the differences from
the previous section/step using the appropriate link against each section, in this page.

### Demo

There is no online demo, so if you want to take a peek into how the app will look like once it's
done till the end of the book, you will need to do the following:

   1. Install Node.js (with npm) and MongoDB
   2. Clone this repository
   3. Run `npm install` in the project directory
   4. Run `npm run compile`, followed by `npm run compile-server` to generate the bundles
   5. Run `npm start` to start the server on port 3000
   6. (Optionally) Run `mongo scripts/init.mongo.js` to seed the database with some initial data

The above requires that you know, or able to find out how to install Node.js and MongoDB.
